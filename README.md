# Snake JS

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Snake" in JavaScript, created following the tutorial by Akdev on YouTube.

## Overview

The game involves controlling a snake as it moves around a game board. The objective is to eat the food that appears randomly on the board, causing the snake to grow. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the edges of the board.

## Features

- Control the snake using the arrow keys.
- The snake grows each time it eats food.
- Real-time scoring display.
- Collision detection with the board edges and with the snake itself.
